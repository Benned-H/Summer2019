        "The secret here will be a technique called *deep metric learning*. In deep learning, we typically train a network to accept a single input and output some label, but we're instead now *outputting a real-valued feature vector*. The dlib facial recognition network outputs a 128-d vector to quantify each face. The network was training using triplets of faces: two images of the same person and one of some other random person from our dataset. Each training step, the network outputs vectors for all three faces. We then tweak its weights so that two same-person faces have similar vectors and those are both different from the other person. The architecture is based on ResNet-34 with fewer layers and half the number of filters. Trained by Davis King on some 3 million images, the network compares with SOTA on the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) dataset."
