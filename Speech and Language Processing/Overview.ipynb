        "Over this summer, I plan to read as much as I can of Jurafsky and Martin's *Speech and Language Processing* textbook. The draft I've found of the second edition of the textbook has 25 chapters, and my summer is about 14 weeks long. If I can cover two chapters a week, I'd be set, but we'll see how feasible this is. I'm reading this book to prepare for a course this fall that uses it, and per the course's past syllabus, I should be fine if I cover all chapters before 13 as well as chapter 20. I also have a pdf of the third edition's draft which I'll use to supplement chapters that pique my interest."
